## üéØ About the Project

This project is a comprehensive desktop scheduling application designed to meet the complex requirements of a global consulting organization. Developed as the final capstone for a Bachelor's degree in Software Development, it demonstrates a complete understanding of object-oriented programming, database management, and GUI design using only core Java libraries.

### The Vision

The application was built to solve a real-world business problem: managing customers and appointments across multiple international offices (Phoenix, New York, and London). The core objective was to create a reliable, user-friendly tool that could handle the complexities of different languages and time zones, providing a centralized system for consultants.

### Why This Matters

As a capstone project from 2019, this application showcases a strong foundation in software engineering principles without reliance on modern frameworks. It proves an ability to:
- üåê **Handle Internationalization:** The application was built from the ground up to support multiple languages, dynamically translating UI components and error messages based on the user's locale.
- ‚è∞ **Solve Complex Time Zone Logic:** A significant part of the project involved creating a robust system to manage time conversions accurately across different regions, correctly handling daylight saving time.
- üóÑÔ∏è **Master Database Connectivity:** Implemented all database interactions (CRUD operations) using pure JDBC and a MySQL backend, demonstrating a deep understanding of data persistence and management.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Implement Business Rules:** The application enforces critical business logic, such as preventing appointment overlaps and scheduling outside of defined business hours, through a rigorous exception control system.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Secure User Authentication:** A login form that verifies user credentials against the database and detects user location for language and time zone settings.
- **Comprehensive CRM:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for customer records, including name, address, and phone number.
- **Appointment Management:** Full CRUD capabilities for appointments, linking each appointment to a specific customer record.
- **Dual Calendar Views:** An intuitive user interface that allows users to view the appointment calendar by both month and week.
- **Automated Time Zone Adjustments:** Automatically converts and displays all appointment times in the user's local time zone.
- **Smart Appointment Alerts:** Provides an alert upon login if there is an appointment scheduled within the next 15 minutes.
- **Business Rule Enforcement:** Prevents scheduling conflicts, such as overlapping appointments or booking outside of standard business hours (8 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST).
- **In-Depth Reporting:** Generates three key reports: number of appointment types by month, the full schedule for each consultant, and a custom report.
- **User Activity Logging:** Tracks all user login attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) with timestamps in a local `.txt` file for auditing purposes.

## üîß Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

This project required solving several complex problems using only standard Java libraries.

- **Challenge:** **Time Zone Conversion**
  - **Solution:** Leveraged Java's `java.time` (JSR-310) library, including `ZonedDateTime`, `ZoneId`, and `Instant` classes. All appointments were stored in the database in a neutral format (UTC) and converted to the user's local time zone upon retrieval and display, ensuring accuracy for all international offices.

- **Challenge:** **Internationalization & Localization**
  - **Solution:** Implemented resource bundles (`.properties` files) for both English and French. The application detects the user's system language and loads the appropriate language file, allowing for seamless translation of all labels, buttons, and error messages.

- **Challenge:** **Enforcing Business Logic**
  - **Solution:** A multi-layered exception control system was created. Custom exceptions were used for business rule violations (e.g., `AppointmentOverlapException`), while standard `try-catch` blocks handled data validation and database errors, providing clear feedback to the user.

- **Challenge:** **Code Efficiency**
  - **Solution:** Implemented lambda expressions to simplify event handlers for GUI elements and to iterate over collections for report generation, resulting in more concise and readable code.
